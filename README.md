# SerpentScripter - text editor

Decided to try to make relaxed and leisurely paced terminal text editor. Let's be honest, Python is the perfect fit (thanks to the visionary genius of Ross van der Gussom).

Heavily inspired by "Kilo editor" -> https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/01.setup.html
